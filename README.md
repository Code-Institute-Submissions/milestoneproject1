The Monkees - Milestone Project 1

This website is designed to showcase The Monkees catalogue, for fans and new listeners alike.
The focus is on giving their fanbase a hub to enjoy different media by the band,
broadening their audience, and allowing fans and events managers to contact them to arrange
performances. The users are also able to keep up to date with new media and tour dates.



UX

The website was created for both new and old fans of the band. The primary focus was
to showcase their previous work to allow the customers to listen to their music tracks
and watch their videos, and entice them to book the band for performances at events. 

For long time fans of the band, I created the news feed on the home page so that the user
was shown the latest media first. This means those already familiar with the content on the
site can quickly and easily find the newer content. I also felt it was a necessity that they
see their upcoming tour dates, so this was added into a column on the right of the home page.

The media and gallery pages are for the fans to explore the back catalogue of the bands music
and videos. I added a ‘new’ tag for any new media, to catch the eye and further direct the user.

Finally, for users wishing to contact the band for bookings, the contact page was created with
ease and simplicity in mind, so they can message the band with minimal effort.

Whilst the general structure evolved when put into practice, the initial designs reflect the
priorities of the website.

Features

Existing Features

News Feed - This allows users to instantly see all the new content that they have yet to see.

I would like to add links to ticket pages in future iterations of the website, so the customer
can easily purchase a ticket.

Media - Users are able to listen to, and download, the audio files, as well as
view the embedded youtube videos, which will then show other recommended videos to watch.

Gallery - I created the gallery for fans to be able to see various photographs and memorabilia.
They can enlarge photo’s for a better view of the images.

Book us - The book us page allows the user to provide as much information as required about
an event they would like The Monkees to play at.

Features Left to Implement

I would like to add a shop page so that users can buy cd’s, vinyl’s, memorabilia etc.

Testing

I regularly tested the website to make sure that the features were working as expected.
My method of working was to create a section for desktops, run it, make sure this looks and
works correctly, then amend it for the different screen sizes before moving onto the next 
section. Most of the time, if there were any issues, it was a simple fix to resolve these, 
however I did more in depth testing on the following sections of the website:

Book Us Page - I wanted to make sure the booking page would guide the user, as there 
are several boxes to fill out. The most important thing is that they get their email inputted
correctly, so I tested, making sure the bootstrap rules were correctly in place. I also made
sure the user was given feedback that the form was sent by changing the color of the submit
button once the form has been successfully sent.

Gallery

The gallery page required rigorous testing to make sure it showed correctly on all 
screen sizes. With this, I would test each image row by row to make sure the modal with the
englarged image would be presented correctly. I then systematically moved down the 
screen sizes, altering the code slightly until it looked right on all different sizes.



Bugs and Challenges

I had a peculiar bug from the background image on tourdates.html. It would disappear seemingly
at random, I don’t recall changing any code specific to the background image when it
would change. I simply fixed this by copying another background on CSS, pasting it and
amending the file path for the image.

I had trouble getting the drop down menu to work on smaller screens. If the drop down menu
worked, the navigation bar menu items would disappear on larger screens. My fix for this was
to simply remove all code and restart the navigation bar, which proved successful.

I also had trouble with the background image staying static whilst the content below would scroll
over it. It would either scroll along with the content, or disappear entirely. Similar to the
method with the navigation bar, I simply had to delete my code on the background, and input it
again, which resolved the issue.

I took inspiration for the general structure from the website for Pixies - http://www.pixiesmusic.com/
I looked at the website for Idles, which inspired the light and clean aesthetic - https://www.idlesband.com/
The Abba website then helped me to further understand what a fan of music from that era
would like to see on a band website. This inspired me to add a gallery page - https://abbasite.com
Finally, the Beegees website helped inform me on both the style as well as the content - http://www.beegees.com/
